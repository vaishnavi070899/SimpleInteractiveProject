Project 1: Creating an Inclusive Learning Environment: An Open-Source Game for Concentration and Focus Development

### Introduction:
In recognizing the challenges faced by individuals with learning disabilities and difficulties in maintaining focus, I embarked on a project to design an open-source game environment aimed at developing concentration skills. This initiative is motivated by the understanding that an interactive and reward-based approach can significantly enhance the learning experience for this demographic.

#### Objectives:
The primary goals of the project are:
1. Foster concentration and focus development in individuals with learning disabilities.
2. Provide an inclusive and engaging digital platform for skill enhancement.
3. Integrate reward-based mechanisms to motivate and reinforce positive behavior.
4. Promote the exchange of digital points for tangible rewards, encouraging a sense of accomplishment.
